# Kotlin Fundamentals
Code examples taken from the Pluralsight Course: [Kotlin Fundamentals by Kevin Jones](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/kotlin-fundamentals/table-of-contents).

## Set-Up
For the sake of Simplicity (Not installing a new IDE in my old Laptop), I used Visual Studio Code as a Text Editor, and used the Windows cmd to compile and run the examples. 

You can download VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), there are some useful extensions you can download to help you with the Syntax and code experience in General. Also [here's](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html) how to install Kotlin and use the cmd to run the code (if you've already used Java this will be a piece of cake).

However, if you're the type of person who prefers an IDE (and I don't blame you) there're more options you can choose from. That being said [InteliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) is the most recommended one.

## License and Contribution
The code will be taken from the examples on the Pluralsight course; they might slightly vary depending on how creative I feel. Contributions are welcome nonetheless, but they should help make the examples more understandable for the user.
